Who is collaborating?
====================
This simple tool helps researchers and students to visualize who is collaborating with whom in their field of research. 

Accessing bibliographic reference lists it builds a graph showing who published with whom and how often. As bibliographic resources it can tap into your [Mendeley][3] archive or use nearly any bibtex file you upload.

Have a look at the [example picture][2] or try it yourself online at [collabgraph.xcend.de][1].

Requirements:
- pygraphviz library and 
- python 2.7
