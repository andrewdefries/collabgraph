Who is collaborating?
====================
This simple tool helps researchers and students to visualize who is collaborating with whom in their field of research. It reads bibtex files, which are heavily used to organize references in academic publications and builds a graph showing who published with whom and how often. 

Go to collabgraph.xcend.de to see it in action!

It requires pygraphviz library and python 2.7 (which comes with ubuntu 10.10 or newer)
